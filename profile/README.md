What is open-atmos?
 
Open-atmos is a multi-institutional community hub for projects in atmospheric sciences. We support projects that are committed to an open development model. 
This includes: 
*   embracing open-source licenses
*   developing code in public
*   maintaining public issue trackers and discussion forums
*   having automated cloud-hosted workflows executing thorough test suites
*   being open to contributions from the entire community
*   actively facilitating onboarding of new contributors by providing examples and tutorials
*   supporting users with documentation maintained with the code
*   empowering research users with reproducibility-oriented workflows for code dissemination and archiving, ensuring the ability to anonymously review and reuse the code and scientific results obtained with it 
*  adhering to best practices in software engineering

We welcome new members and projects to open-atmos!
